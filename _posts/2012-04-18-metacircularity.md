I found and liked a very good summary of the 'Maxwell Equations of software'
motto from Alan Kay in
[this post](http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/lisp-as-the-maxwells-equations-of-software/)
from Michael Nielsen.

It is nice also because it has running code inspired by all the gurus and books
I like: [Alan Kay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay),
[Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com),
[John McCarthy](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/),
[SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html),
[Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/).
