# How to transfer your DVDs to your Android Tablet

Suppose your kids want to watch their DVDs in the car on their Android tablet...

Here is what you can do (on a Mac OSX 10.9.5):

* install [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr) and its CLI
  
  ```shell
  $ brew cask install handbrake
  $ brew cask install handbrakecli
  ```

* install `libdvdcss` (thanks to [lifehacker's article](http://lifehacker.com/how-to-rip-a-dvd-to-your-computer-5809765)) in order to bypass copy protection
  
  ```shell
  $ brew install libdvdcss
  ```

* go to the place where you will place the ripped DVD:
  
  ```shell
  $ cd ~/Movies
  ```

* convert your DVDs:
  
  ```shell
  $ HandBrakeCLI -i /Volumes/'my DVD' -o my_dvd.mp4 --preset="Android Tablet"
  ```
  (be prepared to wait for some time...it took 1h 8min 5s for an 87min movie on my old MacBook Pro mid-2009)

* copy to the micro SD card:
  ```shell
  $ mv my_dvd.mp4 /Volumes/Untitled/Movies/
  ```

There are other preset configurations...Should you need to copy to a different device, use `HandBrakeCLI --preset-list` to select the one that best fits your needs. Otherwise you can delve into the many settings...!


**Note**: after the conversion I get my DVD driver completely blocked/unable to read disks and ejecting them all.
Sometimes "Repair Disk Permissions" via Disk Utility as described [here](http://www.cnet.com/forums/discussions/macbook-cd-dvd-drive-won-t-read-discs-can-it-be-fixed-330354/#post-970a02c1-3e34-495a-bfd9-44267a4af51c) make it work again... some other times not!

I do the repair via command line as follows (eventually prefix it with `sudo`):

```shell
$ diskutil repairPermissions /
```

Eventually I succeeded using "System Information", selecting 'Disk Burning' and then hitting File -> Refresh Information.
Don't ask me why or how, I just did it and the driver worked again!
