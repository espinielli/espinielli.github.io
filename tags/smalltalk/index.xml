      <description>It seems there is still some hope to see Croquet (or, OpenCobalt which took off from where Croquet stopped) alive and based on latest Squeak and more importantly using Cog VM.
Matthew Fulmer reports it here.

      <description>I have been playing around with Pier.
It is fun, especially when you can extend it to show LaTeX formulae (this is still work in progress given I am using the js from MathJax [even if forbidden], but hey I wanted a proof of concept!)
I will try to complete it: whatch out &amp;lsquo;Beautiful Math for Pier&amp;rsquo; on squeaksource.</description>
