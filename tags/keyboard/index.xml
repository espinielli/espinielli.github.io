      <description>Now that I have a new blog setup, I can more quickly post what has been since long time in the making: my ErgoDox keyboard.
It all started with me reading Steve Yeggeâ€™s blog on touch typing and being convinced I should give it a try with a proper keyboard.
So on 2014-03-24 I joined a Massdrop purchase for an DIY ErgoDox split keyboard. It completed a week later and delivery was done somewhat end of May.</description>
