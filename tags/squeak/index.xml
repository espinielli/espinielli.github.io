      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am probably too selective, anyway my models for computer science/software engineering (one of them would disagree on both definitions) are just two: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Donald E. Knuth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vpri.org/html/people/founders.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Alan Kay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one continues to surprise me with the depth, clarity and joy of his works: from TeX (well, I use LaTex but it does not exist without TeX) to The Art of Computer Programming to Literate Programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the latter, I was one of the blessed to be present to &lt;a href=&#34;http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3972189&amp;amp;amp;srt=year&amp;amp;amp;year=2003&amp;amp;amp;aw=140&amp;amp;amp;ao=AMTURING&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;his Turing Award Lecture&lt;/a&gt;: he shocked me to the point I had two sleepless nights so angry I was about having wasted so much time in useless (computer) matters! After that I have been studying and using a lot of what he wrote and presented from Squeak to Croquet to the Burroughs B5000 and stack computers to his recent line of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vpri.org/html/work/ifnct.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;exploration&lt;/a&gt; and the proposal to NSF about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vpri.org/pdf/rn2006002_nsfprop.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;reinventing programming (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
